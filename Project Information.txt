## Final Project

## Project name: Assessing a Company's Value, combining discounted cash flows method and Monte Carlo simulation.
## Project author: Bilyana Andonova

### Terms and conditions:
By submitting your project for the exam, you agree with the following:
* Use Jupyter notebook for text and maths. You can use any programming language you would like.
* Write your research and code in English. Bulgarian is also acceptable but try to use English.
* If you have sensitive, copyrighted, or copy-protected assets, including but not limited to, images, multimedia, code, documents, and datasets,
  you can sign an NDA (non-disclosure agreement) with the SoftUni team. Contact the lecturer if you need assistance with the process.
* Any code which does not comply with the Bulgarian law (as of the exam date), will be given zero points.
* Any malicious code, or code intended to do harm to the user's computer, information, or privacy, will be given zero points.

### Self-assessment:
The numbers in brackets define possible points for the corresponding item.

1. Problem statement (0-10): 10
	* How well is the problem defined?
	* Does the research address a real-life problem?
	* Does the research solve the correct problem?
2. Layout (0-20): 20
	* Are the document sections structured properly?
	* Is the article well-formatted (in terms of readability)?
3. Code quality (0-20): 17
	* Is the code well-written? Is the code self-documenting?
	* Is the code organized into functions?
	* Is the code generally well-structured?
4. Previous research (0-10): 10
	* Have you cited at least two other sources?
	* Does the project contain comparisons between the current and the previous results?
5. Gathering / generating, cleaning, and formatting data (0-10): 10
	* Every problem deals with "real-world" data in some way. Even if you don't use datasets, you'll likely generate some data
	* How is the data gathered?
	* Is the process statistically valid?
	* Is the process of data acquisition, data cleaning, and data manipulation well documented?
6. Testing (0-10): 8
	* This can have various meanings: unit testing, hypothesis testing, train / test data set, etc.
	* Is the code thoroughly tested?
	* Are there any comparisons to other implementations / other articles / previous research?
7. Visualization (0-10): 10
	* All kinds of projects employ some visualization: graphical plots, tables, etc.
	* Are all visualizations correct (i.e. convey the intended meaning without misleading the intended audience)?
	* Are all visualizations clear, and easy to understand?
8. Communication (0-10): 10
	* Does the project tell the story correctly?
	* Does the project serve the audience it was intended for?
