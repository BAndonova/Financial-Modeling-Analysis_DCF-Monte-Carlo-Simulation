    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Business valuation is a process and a set of procedures used to estimate the economic value of an owner’s interest in a business. The value of an asset is the present value of its expected returns. In order to calculate the value of a company we need to know its expected cash flows and its required rate of return. Company’s future cash flow could be estimated by forecasting future earnings on the basis of company’s historical earnings and the expected growth of both the firm and the market. The required rate of return that is used to discount the company’s estimated future cash flow has to reflect the risk of those cash flows </div>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Most commonly used method for the company evaluations is Discounted Cash Flow (DCF), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Economic Value Added (EVA). Many of these traditional models need to consider one parameter that called free cash flow. When estimating this parameter, the prior models are short of accurate method. For example, when estimating free cash flow we often calculate ROI to get future growth rate then calculate the FCF year by year. Obviously, the application of this method lack operability. Because of this weakness, this kind of model usually used in the field of education only. \n",
    "<b>Monte Carlo simulation</b> precisely solve this problem. This model improve the traditional methods and enhanced the operability by thousands of simulation tests. </div>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">Monte Carlo simulation also called random simulation, was put forward by American scientists in 1940s. The method obtain the approximate results by statistical analysis and stochastic simulation of random variables. Take DCF model as an example, if the free cash flow of the investment project in the future is expressed as a random variable with a certain probability distribution, we can improve the accuracy of traditional model according to the probability distribution of these random variables. \n",
    "Under the manual condition, it is difficult for people to operate thousands of tests. In this case, people prefer to use matlab in the application of Monte Carlo simulation. </div>\n",

    "1. The first figure is the histogram showing the distribution of the the Monte Carlo result regarding the estimaded company value. This histogram is skewed right. The distribution skewed to the right is said to be positively skewed. This kind of distribution has a large number of occurrences in the lower value cells (left side) and few in the upper value cells (right side). The majority of the outcomes from the simulation are on the left side of the red horizontal line which represent the average (mean) value.\n",
    "2. Comulative Distribution Function graph of the estimated company value is situated on the second place. Cumulative frequency is used to determine the number of observations that lie above (or below) a particular value in a data set. The cumulative frequency is calculated by adding each frequency from a frequency distribution table or directly from the data set to the sum of its predecessors. The last value will always be equal to the total for all observations, since all frequencies will already have been added to the previous total. From this graph we can see that almost all of the estimated values of the company are below 6000 MCHF and limited number of the observations falls above this threshold.\n",
    "3. The third diagram is again histogram showing the distribution of the simulated sales growth rate. The histogram looks close to the normal distribution (bell-shaped diagram) with a mean value of -0.0569 (-5.69%) which is shown by the red horizontal line. \n",
    "4. The last graph is the distribution of the estimated discount rates. THe histogram is the uniform distribution of the outccome from the simulation. The diagram indicates that the data that is very consistent; the frequency of each outcome is very similar to that of the others. A data set with a uniform-shaped histogram looks being multimodal – the having multiple intervals with the maximum frequency. It looks that the 10000 itterations are not exactly sufficient since we have a couple of peaks and outliers.  "

    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The Monte Carlo method is a stochastic (random sampling of inputs) method to solve a statistical problem, and a simulation is a virtual representation of a problem. The Monte Carlo simulation combines the two to give us a powerful tool that allows us to obtain a distribution (array) of results for any statistical problem with numerous inputs sampled over and over again.\n",
    "In other words, this has to do with sensitivity analysis: instead of having a simple and basic \"low / medium / high\" scenario kind of model which one would traditionally build on Excel, with the Monte-Carlo simulation we used thousands of variations of the key model's drivers to generate a fair price for the company.\n",
    "These simulations allowed to go beyond deterministic models and inject hazard and stochastic into it. </div>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">When we assess the financial value of a company, there are indeed many random factors which can have an impact on the final company valuation. Revenue can grow at a stronger pace than expected, EBITDA can grow slower than expected, net working capital can also follow another path and so on. Because we used some hard-coded values and a lot of assumptions for the DCF Model variables, we do not have the perfect model and at the same time the model is quite robust for fulfilling the main objective. <br>\n",
    "<div style=\"text-align: justify\">\n",
    "The stochastic approach via the Monte Carlo simulation gives the price to be between <b>-993.27MCHF and 2,122.52 MCHF</b> after having injected 10,000 random hypothesis following a normal or uniform distribution on sales growth rate and discount rate under assumptions for the cost of goods sold, selling general and administrative, interest expenses, capex, depreciation & amortization, change in net working capital.\n",
    "The outcome of the simulations regarding the sales growth rate and the discount rate was incorporated in the Monte Carlo simulation for the estimated company value where we had as a result from the simulations:<br>\n",
    "    - major sales growth rate movement (1 Standard Deviation) between 0.1699 and -0.2679 and <br>\n",
    "    - major discount rate movement (1 Standard Deviation) between 0.0606 and 0.08944.<br>\n",
    " In the end, with the evolution of financial concepts and improvements, there is no single approach that should be totally ignored. It is important to genuinely understand the assumption behind each metric to avoid conclusions that are driven by a model’s assumptions, rather than the economic facts of the problem. In the future and maybe for the time being, there is new research and new models that will possibly further improve the financial concepts. The eventual answer could be that there is no single financial model that can totally replace another and be the panacea. Each of them applies different assumptions and yields a different conclusion. Each framework will generate different answers when applied to real world situations. A manager or an analyst might need multiple points of view in order to make a wise decision.<br>\n",
